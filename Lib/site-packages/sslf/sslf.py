        Parameters
        ----------
        window_length : int, optional
            The window_length to be used in scipy's savgol_filter. This should
            be bigger than the expected width of any spectral lines, but not
            so big that it is comparable to the length of the spectrum. In a
            sense, it specifies how far to look ahead and behind every channel
            when considering bandpass shape. If this is too small, it will
            behave more like a low-pass filter than a high-pass filter, when we
            probably want it to be more on the high-pass side.

        poly_order : int, optional
            The order of the polynomial fitting to be done over the spectral
            lines and with the savgol_filter. 1 (linear) is generally sensible,
            especially as higher orders are susceptible to Runge's phenomenon.

        blank_spectrum_width : float, optional
            The amount of spectrum to filter on either side of a detected
            spectral line. This is in an effort to preserve real signal
            associated with the spectral line that is buried in the noise.

        allowable_peak_gap : int, optional
            The minimum number of channels between any two spectral lines before
            sslf considers them to be the same for the purposes of filtering.
            This avoids using noisy channels between lines for interpolation,
            and getting a poor subtraction. Currently disabled.
