Description: **Note**: This library is deprecated, but it is provided for systems
        or libraries that still depend on pieces of it.  Further development
        of this library is highly unlikely.  You are suggested instead to use
        `WebOb <http://pythonpaste.org/webob/>`_ and construct requests
        manually and use ``req.get_reponse(proxy)``.
        
        This library allows you to make fast calls between cooperating WSGI
        applications, with automatic fallback for non-cooperative applications
        or remote applications.
        
        Requests are sent through WSGI obeying all middleware and the WSGI
        spec.  Serialization/deserialization is avoided when possible.
        
        It can be installed from the `subversion repository
        <http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/HTTPEncode/trunk#egg=HTTPEncode-dev>`_
        with ``easy_install HTTPEncode==dev``
